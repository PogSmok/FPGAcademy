# FPGAcademy Laboratory Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to laboratory exercises from **FPGAcademy**: https://fpgacademy.org/courses.html

---

## Covered Topics

- **RTL Design & Digital Logic:** Verilog design, finite state machines (FSMs), synchronous logic, combinational & sequential circuits  
- **Timing & Constraints:** Clock domains, timing-aware design, FPGA resource planning  
- **FPGA Implementation:** Pin assignments, board programming, DE1-SoC experience  
- **Verification & Simulation:** Functional simulation, testbenches, ModelSim workflow  
- **Embedded & Processor Interfaces:** Nios® V processor, memory-mapped I/O, interrupts, DMA  
- **Projects:** Timers, counters, arithmetic units, simple & enhanced processor designs, character device drivers, graphics and signal acquisition  

## Included Materials

Each laboratory folder contains:
- The original PDF with exercise instructions, and an archive with the provided design files (if applicable)
- Solution source code for each part of the laboratory
- Pin assignment file (`.qsf`) used to program the physical FPGA board  
  *Pin assignments must be adjusted when targeting a different board*

The PDFs and accompanying design archives are included for educational reference only.
All rights to the original materials belong to FPGAcademy.
