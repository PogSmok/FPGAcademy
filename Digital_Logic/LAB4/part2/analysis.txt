The T flip-flop implementation remains the same,
except that an adder is added in front of the two
multiplexers to perform the "Q <= Q + 1" operation.
Analysis of logic utilization shows that during mapping
and fitting, the adder is not fully optimized away.
As a result, doubling the counter size does not simply
double the number of LEs; the 16-bit counter uses 30 LEs
instead of 26 (13*2).
